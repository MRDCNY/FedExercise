<h3><li>Package Definition: </li> </h3>
<p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of 
denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a 
complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
 explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, 
 or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue 
 pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or 
 pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which 
 toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical 
 exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure 
 that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"

<h3><li>How to avail: </li> </h3>
<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
 suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look
 even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure
 there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the
 Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
 It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate 
 Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour,
 or non-characteristic words etc. </p>
